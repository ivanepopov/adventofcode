## Part One
An antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency - but only when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other.
Calculate the impact of the signal. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

## Part Two
After updating your model, it turns out that an antinode occurs at any grid position exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance.
How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?
